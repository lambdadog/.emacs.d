* Prospective Packages
Packages I'm considering for inclusion in my config but don't yet have
a use-case for.
** [[https://github.com/radian-software/apheleia][Apheleia]]
Seems like the perfect code formatter integration, but I don't
currently have anything like that set up in my config.
** [[https://depp.brause.cc/shackle/][Shackle]]
Seems very useful but also very complex to use effectively. Worth some
investigation.
